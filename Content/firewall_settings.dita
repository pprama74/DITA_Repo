<title>Firewall Settings</title>
<body><p>MiTeam Meetings uses services provided by the CloudLink
platform (chat, authorization and authentication, and dialing into
meetings from the PSTN) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Chime SDK
(audio, video, and screen sharing requirements). As a result, MiTeam
Meetings requires the destinations and ports described in this topic to
support various services. If inbound or outbound traffic is blocked,
it might affect the applicationâ€™s ability to use various services,
including audio, video, and screen sharing, and chat.</p>
<p>MiTeam Meetings requires the following network hosts and ports
for it to function.</p>
<section><title>Hosts</title><ul><li>*.mitel.io</li>
<li>*.amazonaws.com</li>
<li>*.bugsnag.com</li>
<li>fonts.gstatic.com</li></ul></section>
<section><title>Ports</title><ul><li>99.77.128.0/18</li>
<li>TCP/443</li>
<li>UDP/3478</li></ul></section>
<p>Web sockets used in the MiTeam Meetings also require an entry
in the allowed list for *.amazonaws.com for the ports defined in <xref  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html." scope="external">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html.</xref>.</p>
<p>If you are using a proxy, ensure that it proxies WebSockets and
HTTPS.</p>
<p>Check using <xref  href="https://app.chime.aws/check" scope="external">Amazon Chime Readiness Checker</xref> whether
your firewall rules require updating.</p></body></topic>
